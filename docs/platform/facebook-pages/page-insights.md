# Page Insights

Represents insights for Facebook Pages and Page posts. Refer to our [Pages API documentation](/docs/pages).

By June 15, 2026, a [number of the Page Insights metrics](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/platforminsights/page/deprecated-metrics) will be deprecated for all API versions. The API returns an invalid metric error when calling any of these metrics. [Read our blog to learn more.](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2026/02/18/introducing-graph-api-v25-and-marketing-api-v25/)

## Reading

Get [metrics](#availmetrics) for Pages or Page posts.

### New Page Experience

This endpoint is supported for [New Page Experience](/docs/pages/new-pages-experience/).

### Limitations

- Page Insights data is only available on Pages with 100 or more likes.
- Most metrics will update once every 24 hours.
- Only the last two years of insights data is available.
- The values for `period` are calculated from the initial collection of the data point.
- "Period" in the tables below only refers to the time frame for which the metric can be accessed in an aggregated form.
- The value "lifetime" means the time period for which the insights data is available. By default, this time period is 2 years or shorter.
- Only 90 days of insights can be viewed at one time when using the `since` and `until` parameters.
- When using `since` and `until`, the `since` date data will be included in the first `value` returned.
- Unique impression insights values are calculated independently.
  - Total page reach may not always be exactly equal to the sum of paid and non-paid unique values.
  - Total page reach may not always be exactly equal to the sum of `viral_unique` and `organic_unique`.
- When an organic post is boosted, metrics for paid post impressions will include both organic and paid reach.
- Demographic metrics, such as age, gender, and location, are only returned if there is data for 100 or more people.
- Breakdown metrics for Page post and Page view insights will only return non-zero values.
- Several video related metrics only return accurate values if the person requesting the metric is the Page video post creator.
- If you reshare a video post of another Page and retrieve its insights, the metrics return a value of 0. Metrics that return 0 for resharers are denoted with "Returns 0 for reshared videos" in their description.
- If you neglect to indicate a specific metric or metrics for the endpoint, you will receive an error response with code `3001`, with subcode `1504028` and an error message that states: "No metric was specified to be fetched. Please specify one or more metrics to be fetched and try again."
- Interactions on Reels are not included.

### Requirements

### Metrics

Metric names indicate whether a metric is for a Page or a Page post.

Suffix | Description || `_unique` | Indicates that the metric shows the number of unique users who performed a specific action, for example `page_impressions_unique`. **Metrics generated with the `_unique` suffix are approximate and may not be 100% accurate.** |
| `_login` | Indicates whether a person was logged into Facebook, for example, `page_tab_views_login_top`. |
| `_logout` | Indicates whether a person is logged out of Facebook, for example `page_views_logout`. |
| `_source` | Indicates that the metric will be broken down into a list of referral sources, for example `page_fans_by_like_source`. External referrals are broken down by domain. Internal referrals are broken down by Facebook-specific features such as **Profile**, **Search**, **Requests**, **Suggestions**, **Stream**, etc. In these cases the `value` returned will be an object containing a series of key-value pairs where the key is the source name and the value is the metric for that source. |
