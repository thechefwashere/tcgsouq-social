# Page Feed

Use this endpoint to get and publish to a Page. The Page Feed encompasses any interactions with a Facebook Page including: posts and links published by this Page, visitors to this Page, and public posts in which the Page has been tagged.

### See Also

- The [`/{page-post-id}` endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/pagepost) allows you to update a specific Page post.
- The [`/{page-id}/tagged` endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/tagged) **to only retrieve public posts in which the Page has been tagged.**

## Reading

The posts of a Facebook Page.

### New Page Experience

This API is supported for New Page Experience.

### Requirements

The person requesting the access token must be able to perform one of the following tasks on the Page:

- CREATE\_CONTENT – Publish content as the Page on the Page
- MANAGE – Assign and manage Page tasks
- MODERATE
  - Respond to comments on Page posts as the Page
  - Delete comments on Page posts
  - If an Instagram account is connected to the Page, publish content to Instagram from Facebook, respond to and delete comments, send Direct messages, sync business contact info, and create ads.

And have granted the app the following permissions are required:

- The [`pages_read_engagement` permission](/docs/pages/overview-1#permissions)
- The [`pages_read_user_content` permission](/docs/pages/overview-1#permissions)

If you do not own or manage the Page, you will need:

- The [Page Public Content Access Feature](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/feature/#reference-PAGES_ACCESS)

When using the Page Public Content Access feature, use a [system user access token](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/503306463479099) to avoid [rate limiting](/docs/graph-api/overview/rate-limiting#pages) issues.

#### Sample Request

}
```

### Limitations

- **Expired Posts** – If a Post has expired, you will no longer be able to view the content using the Graph API.
- **Maximum Posts**
  - The API will return approximately 600 ranked, published posts per year.
  - You can only read a maximum of 100 feed posts with the `limit` field. If you try to read more than that you will get an error message to not exceed 100.
- **Message CTA** - Posts with message CTAs cannot be accessed using another Page's access token since Pages cannot message other Pages.
- **Publicly Identifiable Information** - User information will not be in included in responses unless you make the request with a Page access token.
- **Published Posts** – Published and unpublished posts will be returned when querying the `/{page-id}/feed` endpoint. Use the 'is\_published` field to return only published posts.
- **Shared Posts** - A Page post which shares a post from another Page or person may not be visible if the original post isn't visible with the access token used.
- **Tagged Posts** - When you use `/{page-id}/tagged` to show the posts that tagged this Page, the results include posts from other Pages only if those Pages are authentic.
- **User Agents** - The available user agents allowed for these Graph API calls are subject to change without notice. If you are experiencing issues, you may want to change to a newer version of your particular user agent.
- **Video Posts** - To get a list of video posts, the person making the request must be an admin of the Page.
- **Reels** To get a list of Reels published to your Page, use the [Page VideoReels edge](/docs/graph-api/reference/page/video_reels).

Limitation: All posts (published and unpublished) will be pulled in the feed endpoint. The only difference is unpublished posts will not be listed in the physical feed. However, there is an is\_published field that can be added to the /feed endpoint to let developers know whether the post listed in the /feed endpoint is published or not

When finding posts that can be boosted, the `promotable_id` must be used to create ads. In most cases, this id will be identical to the `post_id`. However, this is not always the case. **Note**: once a post is boosted, you must have access to the connected ad account in order to edit the post.

#### Example Request

```
curl -i -X GET \
 "https://graph.facebook.com/{your-page-id}/feed

## Publishing

You can publish to Pages by using this edge. Either `link` or `message` must be supplied.

### New Page Experience

This API is supported for New Page Experience.

### Requirements

If you can perform the [`CREATE_CONTENT` task](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/overview/permissions-features#tasks), you will need:

- A Page access token
- The [`pages_manage_posts` permission](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/pages_manage_posts)
- The [`pages_read_engagement` permission](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/pages_read_engagement)
- The [`pages_show_list` permission](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/pages_show_list)

Posts will appear in the voice of the Page.

### Permissions

- A Page access token requested by someone who can perform the

  [`CREATE_CONTENT` task](#)

  on the Page being queried
- [The `pages_manage_posts` permission](#)

**Note:** If the viewer or app cannot see the url of `link`, the post will fail.

### Response

```
{"id":"post-id"}
```

This endpoint supports [read-after-write](/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api#read-after-write) and can immediately return any fields returned by [read](/docs/graph-api/reference/page/feed#read) operations.

### Unpublished Page Posts

We support the following types of Unpublished Page Posts:

Post Type | Description || [Link](/docs/graph-api/reference/link) | A link Page post is most effective for sharing links to your website. Allows for optional replacement of image and extra text.  Note: A Youtube video link will be a link Page post. |
| [Photo](/docs/graph-api/reference/photo) | A photo Page post with a text description and an optional link as part of the description. |
| [Post](/docs/graph-api/reference/post) | A Page post with a text description. |
| [Video](/docs/graph-api/reference/video) | A video Page post with optional text description. |

Unpublished Page posts are treated the same as published Page posts except that they do not appear in `/feed`.

To see a list of unpublished Page posts, query the `is_published` field.

```
curl -i -X GET \
 "https://graph.facebook.com/{page-id}/feed
 ?fields=is_published
 &access_token={your-page-access-token}"
```

```
GraphRequest request = GraphRequest.newGraphPathRequest(
  accessToken,
  "/{page-id}/feed",
  new GraphRequest.Callback() {
    @Override
    public void onCompleted(GraphResponse response) {
      // Insert your code here
    }
});

Bundle parameters = new Bundle();
parameters.putString("fields", "is_published");
request.setParameters(parameters);
request.executeAsync();
```

```
FBSDKGraphRequest *request = [[FBSDKGraphRequest alloc]
    initWithGraphPath:@"/{page-id}/feed"
           parameters:@{ @"fields": @"is_published",}
           HTTPMethod:@"GET"];
[request startWithCompletionHandler:^(FBSDKGraphRequestConnection *connection, id result, NSError *error) {
    // Insert your code here
}];
```

```
FB.api(
  '/{page-id}/feed',
  'GET',
  {"fields":"is_published"},
  function(response) {
      // Insert your code here
  }
);
```

```
try {
  // Returns a `FacebookFacebookResponse` object
  $response = $fb->get(
    '/{page-id}/feed?fields=is_published',
    '{access-token}'
  );
} catch(FacebookExceptionsFacebookResponseException $e) {
  echo 'Graph returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();
  exit;
} catch(FacebookExceptionsFacebookSDKException $e) {
  echo 'Facebook SDK returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();
  exit;
}
$graphNode = $response->getGraphNode();
```

To view a post on Facebook.com, you can navigate to https://www.facebook.com/{post-id} for most post types, or retrieve the `actions` field of the post, which contains the URL at which a User can like or comment on the post.

### Custom Link Page Post Image

Post a link to a Page with a customized link image. The story's attachment renders an image retrieved from the link. Currently it is possible to override that image by providing an optional `picture` parameter with a URL to a new image. The `thumbnail` parameter offers similar functionality with the key difference being that the parameter accepts a local image file which is uploaded to Facebook in the API call.

#### Permissions

- A Page access token is required.
- The link must be owned by the posting Page.

To verify link ownership, check the `ownership_permissions{can_customize_link_posts}` field on the `URL` node. You must call this endpoint before posting new links. Without this step, custom link Page posts will not work for un-scraped links. See our [Link Ownership Guide](/docs/sharing/domain-verification) for more information. For versions 2.10 and lower, `picture`, `name`, `thumbnail`, and `description` are deprecated. `caption` is deprecated for all versions.

Parameters | Type | Description || `description` | string | The description of the link (appears beneath the link caption). If not specified, this field is automatically populated by information scraped from the link, typically the title of the page. |
| `name` | string | The name of the link attachment. This field is automatically populated by information scraped from the link. |
| `picture` | string | URL for the image. Image is sourced from the URL supplied in `picture` |
| `thumbnail` | file | Image file to be uploaded. Accepts `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.gif` or `.png`. Image is sourced from the file uploaded in `thumbnail` |

#### Limitations

- The `thumbnail` parameter is only available for link posts on Facebook Pages.
- The `thumbnail` parameter takes higher precedence over the `picture` parameter. If both are supplied the `picture` parameter is unused.
- The `thumbnail` parameter accepts images with extension `.jpg``.jpeg``.gif` or `.png`.
- The `thumbnail` parameter is not supported in batch requests.

### Posting a Link to a Page

Post a link to a Page by sending a POST request to the `/page/feed` edge. Set the `publish` parameter to `1` to publish the post immediately or to `0` to create an unpublished post to be published later.

#### Sample Request

```
curl -i -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/{your-page-id}/feed
  ?message=Become%20a%20Facebook%20developer!
  &link=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com
  &published=1
  &access_token={your-page-access-token}"
```

```
GraphRequest request = GraphRequest.newPostRequest(
  accessToken,
  "/{your-page-id}/feed",
  new JSONObject("{\"message\":\"Become a Facebook developer!\",\"link\":\"https://developers.facebook.com\",\"published\":\"1\"}"),
  new GraphRequest.Callback() {
    @Override
    public void onCompleted(GraphResponse response) {
      // Insert your code here
    }
});
request.executeAsync();
```

```
FBSDKGraphRequest *request = [[FBSDKGraphRequest alloc]
    initWithGraphPath:@"/{your-page-id}/feed"
           parameters:@{ @"message": @"Become a Facebook developer!",@"link": @"https://developers.facebook.com",@"published": @"1",}
           HTTPMethod:@"POST"];
[request startWithCompletionHandler:^(FBSDKGraphRequestConnection *connection, id result, NSError *error) {
    // Insert your code here
}];
```

```
FB.api(
  '/{your-page-id}/feed',
  'POST',
  {"message":"Become a Facebook developer!","link":"https://developers.facebook.com","published":"1"},
  function(response) {
      // Insert your code here
  }
);
```

```
try {
  // Returns a `FacebookFacebookResponse` object
  $response = $fb->post(
    '/{your-page-id}/feed',
    array (
      'message' => 'Become a Facebook developer!',
      'link' => 'https://developers.facebook.com',
      'published' => '1'
    ),
    '{access-token}'
  );
} catch(FacebookExceptionsFacebookResponseException $e) {
  echo 'Graph returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();
  exit;
} catch(FacebookExceptionsFacebookSDKException $e) {
  echo 'Facebook SDK returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();
  exit;
}
$graphNode = $response->getGraphNode();
```

#### Sample Response

```
{"id":"{post-id}"}
```

### Link Page Post with Call to Action

The `call_to_action` field specifies the appropriate action and relevant link. This link should be the same as the `link` parameter of the Page Post. In this call, `title`, `description`, `caption` and `picture` are optional, and when not provided, Facebook will read the equivalent properties from the link's Open Graph meta data. If the linked web page does not have Open Graph meta data, Facebook will try to guess these properties by scraping the web page's content.

#### Sample Request

```
curl -i -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/{your-page-id}/feed
  ?message=Become a Facebook developer!
  &link=https://developers.facebook.com
  &call_to_action={"type":"SIGN_UP","value":{"link":"https://developers.facebook.com"}}
  &published=1
  &access_token={your-page-access-token}"
```

```
GraphRequest request = GraphRequest.newPostRequest(
  accessToken,
  "/{your-page-id}/feed",
  new JSONObject("{\"message\":\"Become a Facebook developer!\",\"link\":\"https://developers.facebook.com\",\"published\":\"1\",\"call_to_action\":\"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"SIGN_UP\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://developers.facebook.com\\\"}}\"}"),
  new GraphRequest.Callback() {
    @Override
    public void onCompleted(GraphResponse response) {
      // Insert your code here
    }
});
request.executeAsync();
```

```
FBSDKGraphRequest *request = [[FBSDKGraphRequest alloc]

           HTTPMethod:@"POST"];
[request startWithCompletionHandler:^(FBSDKGraphRequestConnection *connection, id result, NSError *error) {
    // Insert your code here
}];
```

```
FB.api(
  '/{your-page-id}/feed',
  'POST',
  {"message":"Become a Facebook developer!","link":"https://developers.facebook.com","published":"1","call_to_action":"{\"type\":\"SIGN_UP\",\"value\":{\"link\":\"https://developers.facebook.com\"}}"},
  function(response) {
      // Insert your code here
  }
);
```

```
try {
  // Returns a `FacebookFacebookResponse` object
  $response = $fb->post(
    '/{your-page-id}/feed',
    array (
      'message' => 'Become a Facebook developer!',
      'link' => 'https://developers.facebook.com',
      'published' => '1',
      'call_to_action' => '{"type":"SIGN_UP","value":{"link":"https://developers.facebook.com"}}'
    ),
    '{access-token}'
  );

  exit;
} catch(FacebookExceptionsFacebookSDKException $e) {
  echo 'Facebook SDK returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();
  exit;
}
$graphNode = $response->getGraphNode();
```

#### Sample Response

```
{"id":"{post-id}"}
```

### Link Post with Custom Uploaded Image
