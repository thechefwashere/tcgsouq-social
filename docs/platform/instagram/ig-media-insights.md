# Instagram Media Insights



Represents social interaction metrics on your app user&#039;s Instagram Media object.

## Creating &#123;#create&#125;

This operation is not supported.

## Reading &#123;#read&#125;

**`GET /&lt;INSTAGRAM_MEDIA_ID&gt;/insights`**

Get insights data on an Instagram Media object.

### Limitations

- If insights data you are requesting does not exist or is currently unavailable, the API returns an empty data set instead of `0` for individual metrics.
- Data used to calculate metrics can be delayed up to 48 hours.
- Metrics data is stored for up to 2 years.
- Metrics such as `comments`, `likes`, `views`, and `total_interactions` report organic interaction metrics only; interactions on ads containing a media object are not counted. The `total_likes`, `total_comments`, and `total_views` metrics return aggregated counts that include engagement from promoted/boosted/ad media. These total metrics are available for Instagram API with Facebook Login only. Crossposted Facebook post&#039;s count may be included if that post is accessible by the session user.

#### Album metrics

- Insights data is not available for any media within an [Instagram Media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media) album.

#### Story media metrics

- Story media metrics are only available for 24 hours.
    * Set up [`Instagram` webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/webhooks) and subscribe to the `story_insights` field to get story insights for a story before they expire. You may receive data after the story expires if the story is added to a highlight. This may return different results for API calls, webhook notifications, and UIs.
- Story media metrics with values less than 5 return an error code `10` with the message `(#10) Not enough viewers for the media to show insights`.
- For Stories created by users in Europe and Japan, the `replies` metric now returns a value of `0`.
- Replies made by users in Europe and Japan are not included in `replies` calculations for story media metrics.

#### Webhooks

- Insights webhook for Instagram API with Instagram Login is not supported.

### Breakdowns

You can also include the `breakdown` parameter for specific metrics to divide data into smaller sets based on the specified breakdown value. Values can be:

| `breakdown` value | Response values |
| --- | --- |
| `action_type`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Only compatible with the `profile_activity` metric.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Break down results by the profile component within the native app that viewers tapped or clicked after viewing the app user&#039;s profile. | * `BIO_LINK_CLICKED`&lt;br&gt;* `CALL`&lt;br&gt;* `DIRECTION`&lt;br&gt;* `EMAIL`&lt;br&gt;* `OTHER`&lt;br&gt;* `TEXT` |
| `story_navigation_action_type`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Only compatible with the `navigation` metric.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Break down results by navigation action taken by the viewer upon viewing the media within the native app. Adding all of these action types will give you the total navigation insights. | * `SWIPE_FORWARD` equals &quot;Next Story&quot;&lt;br&gt;* `TAP_BACK` equals &quot;Back&quot;&lt;br&gt;* `TAP_EXIT` equals &quot;Exit&quot;&lt;br&gt;* `TAP_FORWARD` equals &quot;Forward&quot; |

**NOTE:** If you request a metric that doesn&#039;t support breakdowns, the API will return an error (&quot;`An unknown error has occurred.`&quot;), so be careful if requesting multiple metrics in a single query.

### Response syntax
