# Instagram Account Insights



Represents social interaction metrics on your app user&#039;s Instagram business or creator account.

In this guide, we use **Instagram user** and **Instagram account** interchangeably.

**Success:** Available for the Instagram API with Facebook Login and Instagram API with Instagram Login.

**Warning:** The following metrics have been deprecated for v22.0 and will be deprecated for all versions on April 21, 2025:

* `impressions`

Introducing the new `views` metric with `total_value` metric type and with breakdowns for `follower_type` and `media_product_type`.

Visit the [Instagram Platform Changelog](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/changelog) for more information.

## Creating

This operation is not supported.

## Reading

**`GET /&lt;YOUR_APP_USERS_INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID&gt;/insights`**

Returns insights on your app user&#039;s Instagram business or creator account.

### Requirements

|  | Instagram API with Instagram Login | Instagram API with Facebook Login |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access Tokens** | * Instagram User access token | * [Facebook User access token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens#usertokens) |
| **Host URL** | `graph.instagram.com` | `graph.facebook.com` |
| **Login Type** | Business Login for Instagram | Facebook Login for Business |
| [**Permissions**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference#i) | * `instagram_business_basic`&lt;br&gt;* `instagram_business_manage_insights` | * `instagram_basic`&lt;br&gt;* `instagram_manage_insights`&lt;br&gt;* `pages_read_engagement`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the app user was granted a role on the [Page](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/overview#pages) connected to your app user&#039;s Instagram professional account via the Business Manager, your app will also need:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* `ads_management`&lt;br&gt;* `ads_read` |

### Limitations

- `follower_count` and `online_followers` metrics are not available on Instagram business or creator accounts with fewer than 100 followers.
- Insights data for the `online_followers` metric is only available for the last 30 days.
- If insights data you are requesting does not exist or is currently unavailable, the API will return an empty data set instead of `0` for individual metrics.
- Demographic metrics only return the top 45 performers.
- Only viewers for whom we have demographic data are used in demographic metric calculations.
- Summing demographic metric values may result in a value less than the follower count (see previous bullet point).
- Data used to calculate metrics may be delayed up to 48 hours.

### Host Path Parameters

```html
GET https://&lt;HOST_URL&gt;/&lt;API_VERSION&gt;/&lt;APP_USERS_INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID&gt;/insights
```

| Placeholder | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `&lt;API_VERSION&gt;`&lt;br&gt;The latest version is: v25.0&lt;br&gt; | The API version your app is using when making calls to Meta servers.&lt;br&gt;[Learn more about API versioning.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/guides/versioning)&lt;br&gt; |
| `&lt;APP_USERS_INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID&gt;` | **Required.** The ID of your app user&#039;s Instagram professional account. |
| `&lt;HOST_URL&gt;` | **Required.** The ID of your app user&#039;s Instagram professional account. |

### Parameters

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `access_token` | **Required.** The app user&#039;s Facebook User or Instagram access token. |
| `breakdown` | Designates how to break down result set into subsets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*  `contact_button_type` – Divides results by profile component in the native app.&lt;br&gt;*  `follow_type` – Breaks down results by followers or non-followers.&lt;br&gt;* `media_product_type` – Breaks down results by surface where Instagram users view or interact with your app user&#039;s media. |
| `metric` | **Required.** Comma-separated list of [Metrics](#metrics) you want returned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;`&lt;COMMA_SEPARATED_LIST_OF_METRICS&gt;` |
| `metric_type` | Designates if you want the responses aggregated by time period or as a simple total. See [Metric Type](#metric-type). `&lt;METRIC_TYPE&gt;` |
| `period` | **Required.** [Period](#period) aggregation. `&lt;PERIOD&gt;` |
| `since` | Unix timestamp indicating start of range. See [Range](#range).&lt;br&gt;`&lt;START_TIME&gt;` |
| `timeframe` | **Required for demographics-related metrics.** Designates how far to look back for data. See [Timeframe](#timeframe). `&lt;TIMEFRAME&gt;` |
| `until` | Unix timestamp indicating end of range. See [Range](#range).  `&lt;STOP_TIME&gt;` |

### Breakdown

If you request `metric_type=total_value`, you can also specify one or more breakdowns, and the results will be broken down into smaller sets based on the specified breakdown. Values can be:

* `contact_button_type` — Break down results by profile UI component that viewers tapped or clicked. Response values can be:
    * `BOOK_NOW`
    * `CALL`
    * `DIRECTION`
    * `EMAIL`
    * `INSTANT_EXPERIENCE`
    * `TEXT`
    * `UNDEFINED`
* `follow_type` — Break down results by followers or non-followers. Response values can be:
    * `FOLLOWER`
    * `NON_FOLLOWER`
    * `UNKNOWN`
* `media_product_type` — Break down results by the surface where viewers viewed or interacted with the app user&#039;s media. Response values can be:
    * `AD`
    * `STORY`
    * `REEL` (same as `REELS`)
    * `CAROUSEL_CONTAINER` and `POST` as subtypes of `FEED`

Refer to the [Metrics](#metrics) table to determine which metrics are compatible with a breakdown. If you request a metric that doesn&#039;t support a breakdown, the API will return an error (`&quot;An unknown error has occurred.&quot;`), so be careful if requesting multiple metrics in a single query.

If you request `metric_type=time_series`, breakdowns will not be included in the response.

### Metric Type

You can designate how you want results aggregated, either by time period or as a simple total (with breakdowns, if requested). Values can be:

* `time_series` — Tells the API to aggregate results by time period. See [Period](#period).
* `total_value` — Tells the API to return results as a simple total. If breakdowns are included in the request, the result set will be further broken down by the specific breakdowns. See [Breakdown](#breakdown).

### Period

Tells the API which time frame to use when aggregating results. Only compatible with interaction-related metrics.

### Timeframe

Tells the API how far to look back for data when requesting demographic-related metrics. This value overrides the `since` and `until` parameters.

### Range

Assign UNIX timestamps to the `since` and `until` parameters to define a range. The API will only include data created within this range (inclusive). If you do not include these parameters, the API will look back 24 hours.

For demographics-related metrics, the `timeframe` parameter overrides these values. See [Timeframe](#timeframe).
