# IG Media



Represents an Instagram album, photo, or video (uploaded video, live video, reel, or story).

Introducing the following field:

* `legacy_instagram_media_id`

The following Marketing API Instagram Ads endpoint fields are not supported:

* `filter_name`
* `location`
* `location_name`
* `latitude`
* `longitude`

## Creating

This operation is not supported.

## Reading &#123;#reading&#125;

**`GET /&lt;IG_MEDIA_ID&gt;`**

Gets [fields](#fields) and [edges](#edges) on Instagram media.

### Requirements

|  | Instagram API with Instagram Login | Instagram API with Facebook Login |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access Tokens** | * Instagram User access token | * [Facebook User access token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens#usertokens) |
| **Host URL** | `graph.instagram.com` | `graph.facebook.com` |
| **Login Type** | Business Login for Instagram | Facebook Login for Business |
| [**Permissions**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference#i) | * `instagram_business_basic` | * `instagram_basic`&lt;br&gt;* `pages_read_engagement`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the app user was granted a role via the Business Manager on the [Page](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/overview#pages) connected to your app user&#039;s Instagram professional account, your app will also need one of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* `ads_management`&lt;br&gt;* `ads_read` |

### Limitations

- Fields such as `comments_count` and `like_count` return engagement on the target Instagram media only and don&#039;t include data from other surfaces. For example, `comments_count` returns the number of comments on a photo, but not comments on ads that contain that photo. Use `total_comments_count` and `total_like_count` to get aggregated counts that include engagement from promoted/boosted/ad media. Crossposted Facebook post&#039;s count may be included if that post is accessible by the session user.
- Captions don&#039;t include the `&#064;` symbol unless the app user is also able to perform admin-equivalent [tasks](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/pages-api/overview#tasks) on the app.
- Some fields, such as `permalink`, cannot be used on photos within albums (children).
- Live video Instagram Media can only be read while they are being broadcast.
- This API returns only data for media owned by Instagram professional accounts. It can not be used to get data for media owned by personal Instagram accounts.
- The `reposts_count`, `saved_count`, `shares_count`, `total_like_count`, `total_comments_count`, and `total_views_count` fields are not available for carousel child media and are only returned for top-level media objects. The media owner can disable showing likes, comments, views, reposts, and shares — in these cases, the corresponding fields are not returned.
