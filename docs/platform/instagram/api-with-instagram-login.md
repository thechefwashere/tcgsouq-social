# Instagram API with Instagram Login



The Instagram API with Instagram Login allows
[Instagram professionals](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522)
— businesses and creators — to use your app to manage their presence on Instagram. The API can be used to:

**Success:** Instagram Media Insights are now available for Instagram API with Instagram Login. [Learn more.](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media/insights)

* **Comment moderation** – Manage and reply to comments on their media
* **Content publishing** – Get and publish their media
* **Media Insights** - Get insights on their media
* **Mentions** – Identify media where they have been &#064;mentioned by other Instagram users
* **Messaging** – Send and receive messages with customers or people interested in their Instagram account

**Note:** This API setup does not require a Facebook Page to be linked to the Instagram professional account.

**Warning:** To ensure consistency between scope values and permission names, we are introducing new `scope` values for the Instagram API with Instagram login. The new `scope` values are:

* `instagram_business_basic`
* `instagram_business_content_publish`
* `instagram_business_manage_messages`
* `instagram_business_manage_comments`

These will replace the existing `business_basic`, `business_content_publish`, `business_manage_comments` and `business_manage_messages` `scope` values, respectively.

Please note that the old scope values will be deprecated on **January 27, 2025**. It is essential to update your code before this date to avoid any disruption in your app&#039;s functionality. Failure to do so will result in your app being unable to call the Instagram endpoints.

## Limitations

- This API setup cannot access ads or tagging.
