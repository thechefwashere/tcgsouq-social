Set the new `is_ai_generated` parameter to `true` when [creating a media container](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user/media#creating) to apply the AI info label. For carousels, set `is_ai_generated` on the carousel container only. Available in both Instagram API with Facebook Login and Instagram API with Instagram Login. `is_ai_generated` field is also now available on the [IG Media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media) endpoint.

### Instagram Audio API

_Applies to all versions._

Introducing the [**Instagram Audio API**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/content-publishing/audio-api) for apps using Facebook Login. The API lets your app search for and retrieve audio — original sounds from Reels and royalty-free music from Meta&#039;s Sound Collection — and attach it to Reels at creation time.

This release also adds an ads use case for discovering replacement audio for Instagram Reels ads: when a Reel contains copyrighted music, your app can find royalty-free Sound Collection tracks to replace it. To apply a discovered track to a Reels ad, see [IG Audio Swap for Instagram Reels Ads](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/out-of-cycle-changes/occ-2026#ig-audio-swap-for-instagram-reels-ads).

* **Past partnership ads media:** You can now query a creator&#039;s historical partnership ads media that the creator owns.

See [Creator Marketplace API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login/creator-marketplace) documentation for more information.

### Partnership Ads
_Applies to all versions._

* **Username filtering on ad permissions:** The `/&#123;business-account-id&#125;/branded_content_ad_permissions` endpoint now supports filtering by `creator_username`, allowing you to search and retrieve ad permissions for a specific creator.

See [Ad Codes](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/ad-creative/partnership-ads/ad-codes) for more information.

## March 13, 2026

The Instagram Direct Send API now supports sending the images with attachment IDs (in addition to image URLs) which resolves the problem of timeouts when uploading multiple large high-quality images from slow servers. You can use the attachment API to upload the images one at a time and reuse the attachment IDs to send the same image to multiple users. See the [updated dev docs](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/messaging-api).

## February 6, 2026

Added support for the `enable_fb_login` parameter in Instagram OAuth authorization requests. This allows developers to control whether the Facebook Login option is shown on the Instagram login page prior to authorization. The default value is `true`. See [Business Login for Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/business-login) for more information.

## December 19, 2025
### Instagram PDF Attachment

You can now upload and send PDF file attachment in Instagram Direct using [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/instagram-messaging/features/send-message) for Instagram accounts linked with a Facebook page OR the [Instagram API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/messaging-api) for Intagram-only accounts.

## December 12, 2025

The Instagram Messaging webhook now includes link sticker URLs when users reply to stories via direct message. A new `link_sticker_url` field has been added to the `reply_to.story` object in webhook payloads.

This new field can be used to trigger different messaging automations based on Link Sticker URL in the story.

## December 3, 2025

### Accept/Decline Collaboration Invites

_Applies to all versions._

Introducing [**Accept/Decline Collaboration Invites**](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login/collaboration) in [Instagram API with Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login) on the [IG User](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user). The API provides the following capabilites:

* Query all the IG Media(s) where the app user&#039;s Instagram user has been invited for collaboration
* Accept/Decline a collaboration invite using `media_id` of the tagged IG Media

**Endpoints**

* `GET /&lt;IG_USER_ID&gt;/collaboration_invites`
* `POST /&lt;IG_USER_ID&gt;/collaboration_invites`

`instagram_basic` permission is required to access these endpoints.

### Insights Metrics

_Applies to all versions._

Introducing the following metrics fields for media insights:

* `reels_skip_rate`

* `reposts`

Introducing the following metrics fields for user insights:

* `reposts`

Additional views metric for Reels crossposted to Facebook:

* `crossposted_views`

* `facebook_views`

Currently, the IG Insights API only returns metrics native to Instagram. However, certain media type like Reels can be crossposted to Facebook, and the aggregation of the views on both platforms shows up on the native Instagram app. Now, `crossposted_views` returns the total number of views for reels that are crossposted to Facebook across both platforms. `facebook_views` returns the total number of views specifically from Facebook.

This change does not affect the Business Discovery API. For media accessed via this API, `view_count` will continue to reflect only Instagram views and will not include aggregated crossposted views.

### Supporting Trial Reels in the Content Publishing API

_Applies to all versions._

Introducing **Trial Reels Support** in [Instagram API with Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-facebook-login) and [Instagram API with Instagram Login](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login) for the [Content Publishing API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/content-publishing).

`trial_params` is optional and part of the [create media](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-graph-api/reference/ig-user/media#creating) endpoint. Users will be able to specify a Trial Reel configuration to create and publish Trial Reels directly from the Instagram API.

### Delete Instagram Media

_Applies to all versions._

```
DELETE /&#123;ig_media_id&#125;
```

The new API lets your app delete Instagram posts, carousels, reels and stories from your app user’s Instagram account with a new required permission `instagram_manage_contents`.

Read more about the Instagram Media Delete API [**here**](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media).

## November 10, 2025

You can now send a collection of images in Instagram Direct. See the [updated dev docs](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/messaging-api).
**Warning:** November 3, 2025: Multi-image sending is a Beta feature that will be rolled out incrementally over a few weeks . While the feature is rolled out, some Instagram accounts may get an error response [`2534068`](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/instagram-platform/instagram-api-with-instagram-login/messaging-api#send-images) to indicate that the feature is not yet available for that account.

## September 23, 2025

## June 14, 2025

### Business Login for Instagram

_Applies to all versions._

Introducing the `force_reauth` parameter for Business Login for Instagram. When included in the login flow, this parameter fixes the broken login experience by forcing the app user to reauthenticate even if the user is already logged into Instagram.

We recommend adding the `force_reauth` parameter to your app&#039;s Business Login for Instagram flow, especially if your app users log in on mobile devices.
