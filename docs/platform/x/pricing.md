The X API uses **pay-per-usage** pricing. No subscriptions—pay only for what you use.

---

## [​](#how-it-works) How it works

## Credit-based

Purchase credits upfront in the Developer Console. Credits are deducted as you make API requests.

## Per-endpoint pricing

Different endpoints have different costs. View current rates in the Developer Console.

## No commitments

No contracts, subscriptions, or minimum spend. Start and stop anytime.

## Real-time tracking

Monitor usage and costs live in the Developer Console.

### [​](#webhook-events) Webhook events

Webhook events delivered through the [X Activity API](/x-api/activity/introduction) are billed per event delivered, using the same event names shown in the Activity API docs. You are charged once per billable event, deduplicated within the same 24-hour UTC window as other resources.

| Event | Cost per event |
| --- | --- |
| `post.create` | $0.005 |
| `post.delete` | Not billed |
| `follow.follow` | $0.010 |
| `follow.unfollow` | $0.010 |
| `mute.mute` | $0.001 |
| `mute.unmute` | $0.001 |
| `block.block` | $0.001 |
| `block.unblock` | $0.001 |
| `profile.update.*` | $0.005 |
| `chat.received` | $0.010 |
| `chat.sent` | Not billed |
| `chat.conversation_join` | Not billed |
| `dm.received` | $0.010 |
| `dm.sent` | Not billed |
| `dm.read` | Not billed |
| `dm.indicate_typing` | Not billed |

| `spaces.start` | $0.005 |
| `spaces.end` | $0.005 |

## [​](#owned-reads) Owned Reads

Owned Reads are requests made by your own developer app for your own data (posts, bookmarks, followers, likes, lists, and more). These endpoints are priced at **$0.001 per resource** (1,000 resources for $1).
The following endpoints qualify for Owned Read pricing when `{id}` matches the authenticated user and that user is the owner of the developer app:

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/tweets` | Your own posts |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/mentions` | Your mentions |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/liked_tweets` | Posts you liked |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/bookmarks` | Your bookmarks |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/followers` | Your followers |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/following` | Accounts you follow |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/blocking` | Accounts you blocked |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/muting` | Accounts you muted |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/owned_lists` | Lists you own |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/followed_lists` | Lists you follow |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/list_memberships` | Lists you belong to |
| `GET /2/users/{id}/pinned_lists` | Your pinned lists |

Owned Reads make it significantly cheaper to build apps that work with a user’s own data, such as dashboard apps, personal analytics, or account management tools.

## [​](#deduplication) Deduplication

All resources are deduplicated within a **24-hour UTC day window**. If you request and are charged for a resource (such as a Post), requesting the same resource again within that window will not incur an additional charge.
This means:

- Requesting the same Post multiple times in a day counts as one charge
- The deduplication window resets at midnight UTC
- This applies to all billable resources (Posts, users, etc.)

Deduplication is a **soft guarantee**. While it occurs in the vast majority of cases, there may be specific edge cases like service outages that result in resources not being deduplicated.

---

## [​](#credit-balance) Credit balance

Your credit balance is displayed in the Developer Console. Credits are deducted in real-time as you make API requests.

Monitor your credit balance regularly to avoid service interruptions. Add credits before your balance reaches zero to ensure uninterrupted API access.***Note:** It is possible for an account credit balance to go slightly negative. In this case, API requests will be blocked until you add credits to cover the negative balance.*

### [​](#auto-recharge) Auto-recharge

Enable auto-recharge to automatically top up your credit balance and avoid service interruptions. Configure this in the Developer Console:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Recharge amount** | The amount to add when auto-recharge triggers (e.g., $25) |
| **Trigger threshold** | Auto-recharge activates when your balance falls below this amount (e.g., $5) |

#### [​](#when-the-trigger-fires) When the trigger fires

Auto-recharge triggers the first time your balance drops below the trigger threshold after having been **at or above** it. A balance exactly equal to the threshold counts as armed: if you purchase $5 of credits with a $5 trigger threshold, your very first spend takes the balance below the threshold and a top-up is triggered.

Auto-recharge requires a saved payment method set as your default. You can cancel anytime in the Developer Console or by contacting support.

#### [​](#auto-recharge-safeguards) Auto-recharge safeguards

To protect you from runaway or unexpectedly large charges, auto-recharge has two built-in limits:

- **One top-up per 5-minute window.** Automatic charges can trigger at most once every 5 minutes, so a sudden burst of usage cannot stack multiple recharges back-to-back.
- **Paused at zero or negative balance.** Auto-recharge does not run while your account balance is zero or negative. Add credits manually to resume automatic top-ups.

If your usage is bursty enough to drain a full recharge in under 5 minutes, you can still see “out of credits” errors even with auto-recharge on. Raise your **Recharge amount** so a single top-up comfortably outlasts a 5-minute window of your peak consumption.

---

### [​](#spending-limits) Spending limits

Set a maximum amount you can spend per billing cycle to control costs. When the limit is reached, API requests will be blocked until the next billing cycle.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Spending limit** | Set a specific dollar amount as your maximum spend per billing cycle |

Use spending limits to prevent unexpected charges, especially during development and testing.

## [​](#free-xai-api-credits) Free xAI API credits

When you purchase X API credits, you can earn free [xAI API](https://docs.x.ai) credits based on your cumulative spend during a billing cycle.

To receive free xAI credits, you must link your xAI team to your X developer account. You can do this by visiting your account settings in the [developer console](https://console.x.com).

### [​](#how-it-works-2) How it works

Your cumulative spend is tracked throughout each billing cycle. As you cross spending thresholds, you unlock higher reward rates. When a new billing cycle starts, your cumulative spend resets to $0.

| Cumulative spend | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| $0 – $199 | 0% |
| $200 – $499 | 10% |
| $500 – $999 | 15% |
| $1,000+ | 20% |

The rate applies to your **entire cumulative balance**, but you only receive the delta—what’s newly owed minus what was already credited.

### [​](#example) Example

Suppose you make several purchases throughout a billing cycle:

| Purchase | Rate | Total owed | Already credited | You receive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $100 | 0% | $0 | $0 | **$0** |
| $100 | 10% | $20 | $0 | **$20** |
| $150 | 10% | $35 | $20 | **$15** |
| $150 | 15% | $75 | $35 | **$40** |
| $250 | 15% | $112.50 | $75 | **$37.50** |
| $250 | 20% | $200 | $112.50 | **$87.50** |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| **$1,000** |  |  |  | **$200** |

This is the same amount you’d receive from a single $1,000 purchase—the order and size of purchases doesn’t affect your total rewards.

## [​](#monitoring-usage) Monitoring usage

Track your API usage programmatically with the [Usage endpoint](/x-api/usage/introduction):

```
curl "https://api.x.com/2/usage/tweets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN"
```

This returns daily Post consumption counts, helping you:

- Track consumption against your budget
- Set up alerts when approaching limits
- Identify high-consumption endpoints
- Generate usage reports
